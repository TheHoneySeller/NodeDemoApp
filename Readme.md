# NodeDemoApp
This is a web app which uses Node.js React.js MongoDB and Mongoose.

# Build and Run
This app requires a MongoDB database named demo to run in your system with 3 collections named: orders, parentproducts and vendors. Create these and import the extracted data. The data is not provided in the repository for privacy reasons.

run:

    npm install
and

    npm start
on frontend and backend directories. 

The frontend is initilized using Create React App.

Enter a vendorId to the form and click submit. Ofcourse in a real application ids would be transparent to the user but this is a quick demo app.

And hire me please :)
